Please note this is still a work in progress. 

My last deployment was a while ago, and the osu!Track Project is still being worked on. The authentication on the latest
deployment might still be broken as well. But the solar system project is there in its entirety.

However, I'm exposing this in the hopes that you will at least look at what I've coded so far.

This website does not use any frameworks, and this is intentional. I want to build a good foundation for JS before
learning things like React or Next.
