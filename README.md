Please note this is still a work in progress. 

The osu!Track Project is still being worked on.

However, I'm exposing this in the hopes that you will at least look at what I've coded so far.

The website is built with Node.js, some jQuery for the table on the osu!Track project and it uses supabase a s a backend to provide database functionality as well as support my use of the osu! API via edge functions.

I want to make this more seprate in the future, currently all projects are being hosted from this repository that includes the Solar System project and osu!Track. I hope to seperate these somehow and just make this a kind of sekeleton that links to the other projects.
