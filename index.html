I am 25 years old and have been working on getting my Bacholor's degree in computer sience from the University of South Africa since mid 2020. I have 1 year left in my studies to finish off some 2 or 3 modules. Currently I have no industry experience, or experience working in a team. It is my hope that making this portfolio site will do enough to show off what I've learnt over the years to help me secure a job and start gradually building up some of the much needed knowladge and skills I require to one day become a Full Stack software enginieer.</p> <h2>Projects:</h2> <div class="project-listing"> <div class="project"> <div class="image-window"> <a href="solarsystem.html"><img src="solar-system.8fe21851.png"></a> </div> <h3 class="project-title">Solar System in three.js</h3> <p class="desc">This is a project I made for my computer graphics class. It utilises three.js to create a model of the solar system.</p> </div> </div> </main> </body></html>
