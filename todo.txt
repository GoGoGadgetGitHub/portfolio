//get a simple edge function working to get the hang of it

have that edge fucnction use the osu api the fetch the recent plays of a spesified user

I need to find the right end point, odd are it's api/v2/scores. but this seems like it needs authentication from a spesicfic user to make it do what i want it to

then make a wrapper js file that wraps the edge function call to make using it simpler(in progress)
