get a simple edge function working to get the hang of it

have that edge fucnction use the osu api the fetch the recent plays of a spesified user

then make a wrapper js file that wraps the edge function call to make using it simpler

i'm confused on how to make sure that my osu client secret remains secret i think the idea is to have the key set as an enviremnet variable in supabase then have the edge function access that variable
